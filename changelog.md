* Seekbar int overflow bug fixed.

* Performance optimizations and code cleaning.
* Language option: PyMusX now supports multiple languages! for now it's only 3 supported language available:

 I might add supports for more languages in the future, please be patient, there's only 1 Developer.
 You can also contribute to translate it to your language!

# Running the App
* If you want to run the bare script (pymusxcore.py) then you need
to install VLC media player, PyMusX requires few DLLs from VLC media player
to function properly.
[Download VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org)

* Otherwise, if you want to run the binary version, then you dont need to install
anything, just download PyMusX Installer, install it and you can run it right away.
